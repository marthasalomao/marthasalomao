 <h2>Hello, there! 💫 </h2>


I've been an iOS Developer since 2021. Day-to-day, I build features, refactor code, squash bugs, and navigate through mazes of legacy code.

My joy is bringing designers' screen and button animations to life, embracing creative solutions. Constant learning is crucial to me, and what captivates me most is the unpredictability - each day brings new challenges and opportunities to create something."

✦ I've also worked in the photography field, and I have interests such as pets, cooking, and my favorite drink is an espresso martini.
